Using YOLOv8â€™s deep learning capabilities with PATH (Predictive Algorithm for Traffic Hazards) and sensor fusion to analyse the speed, acceleration and trajectory of nearby cars in real-time we can provide accurate collision predictions and proactive alerts. Retrofits older vehicles without the need for expensive upgrades.
